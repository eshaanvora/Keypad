# Keypad Program

This repo contains program files used to create the Keypad program, which locks and unlocks based on the correct user inputted combination. The application was developed using the Unity platform.

The Keypad program flashes red when the user enters an incorrect combination and unlocks when the user enters the right combination via the UI buttons

Please view the 'DemoScreenshot_Accepted.png' and 'DemoScreenshot_Rejected.png' files to view a sample of the program functionality
